        <h3>Introduction to Mushroom Risotto</h3>
        <p width="530">Mushroom Risotto is a classic Italian dish renowned for its <em>rich, creamy texture</em> and <strong>strong earthy flavors.</strong>
            This comforting dish features Arborio rice, a short-grain rice known for its ability to absorb liquids and release starch, resulting in a creamy consistency. 
            <br></br>
            The key ingredient, mushrooms, adds a <strong>delightful umami taste</strong>, complemented by the savory combination of onions and garlic.
            This dish is a celebration of <em>simplicity and elegance</em>, where the rice is slowly cooked to perfection by gradually incorporating warm broth.
            <br></br>
            The addition of white wine enhances the flavors, while Parmesan cheese and butter contribute to the velvety finish.
            Garnished with fresh parsley, Mushroom Risotto is a timeless favorite that promises a satisfying and indulgent dining experience.

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Prepare Broth;</strong>
                    <br>
                    Heat the chicken broth in a separate pot and keep it warm over low heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Sauté Onions and Garlic:</strong>
                <br>
                In a large pan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add chopped onions and garlic, sauté until they become translucent.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Cook Mushrooms:</strong>
                <br>
                Add sliced mushrooms to the pan and cook until they release their moisture and become golden brown.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Toast Rice:</strong>
                <br>
                Stir in the Arborio rice, ensuring each grain is coated with oil. Toast for 1-2 minutes until the edges become translucent.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Deglaze with Wine:</strong>
                <br>
                Pour in the white wine, stirring constantly. Allow the wine to be absorbed by the rice.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Add Broth:</strong>
                <br>
                Begin adding the warm broth one ladle at a time. Stir constantly and allow the liquid to be absorbed before adding the next ladle. Continue until the rice is creamy and cooked to al dente texture.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Finish with Butter and Cheese:</strong>
                <br>
                Once the rice is cooked, stir in the butter and Parmesan cheese. This will add creaminess and enhance the flavor. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Garnish and Serve:</strong>
                <br>
                Remove the risotto from heat, garnish with fresh chopped parsley, and serve immediately. Optionally, you can sprinkle some extra Parmesan on top.
                <br>
